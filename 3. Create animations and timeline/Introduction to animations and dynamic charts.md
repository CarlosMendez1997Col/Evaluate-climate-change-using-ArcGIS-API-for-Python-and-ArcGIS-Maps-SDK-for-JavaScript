A RCM is a coupled and derived version of a Global Climate Model (GCM) where through a series of simulations and iterations, climate factors (rainfall, temperature, wind, etc) and their correlation with extreme weather phenomena (droughts, floods, hurricanes, etc) are predicted.

Below, I share with you a fraction of the droughts for the years 2026 and 2027 based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios.
